# Proposal for a Project: Development of an Online Dashboard for Data Management and Visualization

**Advisor and Contacts:** Nuno Pereira (nuno.pereira@ubi.pt)

## Summary / Scope

The aim is to develop a responsive web application that integrates IoT data management and visualization, and QR code functionality for gamification. This application will provide a unified platform that includes the aggregation of data from various IoT devices, supporting diverse data types such as text, numerical data, and multimedia, with real-time data updates and synchronization, alongside interactive data visualizations. Furthermore, the application will incorporate QR code functionality, enabling users to retrieve points or information related to IoT devices through a QR code scanner, and generate QR codes for sharing points or generate coupons. In addition to these features, the application will also include gamification elements, specifically the capture and analysis of images for specific subject identification, coupled with a point-based reward system.

## Objectives

1.  **System Development and Integration**
    - Design and implement a web-based platform to aggregate diverse data sources.
    - Develop an architecture that supports the integration of text, numerical data, graphics, and multimedia content.

2.  **UI/UX Design and Prototyping**
    - Create a user interface that is both intuitive and responsive.
    - Develop interactive elements to facilitate data exploration.

3.  **Backend Development and Data Integration**
    - Build a robust backend system to manage data storage, retrieval, and processing.
    - Implement APIs for real-time data updates and synchronization between content sources.

4.  **Testing, Deployment, and Evaluation**
    - Deploy the dashboard on an online server and evaluate its performance under realistic conditions.
    - Gather feedback to refine the system and improve its usability and security.
