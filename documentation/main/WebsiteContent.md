## About Montanha Viva

### Intelligent Predictive System for Sustainability Decision Support

**The Project**

Through the initiative of the University of Beira Interior - Center for Mechanical and Aerospace Sciences and Technologies (C-MAST), Montanha Viva seeks to discuss the relationships between Tourism, Technology and Sustainability in mountain regions and how these can be reconciled in favor of sustainable tourism.

Thus, the development of an intelligent predictive system for sustainability decision support in mountain areas that allows to enhance local wild flora with a view to stimulating increased production and reduced consumption of natural resources, contributing to the promotion of biodiversity and preservation of environmental sustainability.

## Why Montanha Viva?

### Project Rationale

The Serra da Gardunha, an Iberian mountain region of the interior, consists of wild flora and subsistence agriculture. Various environmental, logistical and technological challenges can be problematic.

Thus, it is essential to make agricultural crops more resilient and sustainable.

Promote integrated management of natural resources. And, protect and enhance mountain areas and wild flora. Thus, enhancing environmental and economic sustainability, promoting leisure and health activities and studying and disseminating the potential of wild plants allows the enhancement of local and sustainable wild flora, combating some of the challenges.

## What is the Approach?

### Understanding the Project Objective

Montanha Viva aims to identify and study the bioactive properties of wild plants and disseminate their uses. For this purpose, the implementation of an innovative and autonomous monitoring system for remote areas is under development. Also in production is an intelligent information system that allows supporting local agriculture and encouraging sustainable practices in the mountains.

In addition to this, it favors the development of pedestrian routes with information about flora and its benefits.

Therefore, the project aims to stimulate increased production and reduced consumption of natural resources, contributing to the promotion of biodiversity and preservation of environmental sustainability. As well as providing support for the development of new businesses.
