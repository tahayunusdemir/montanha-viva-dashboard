Welcome to Montanha Viva, a comprehensive web application designed to connect users with nature through technology. Today, we're taking a deep dive into a platform filled with features for adventurers and nature lovers alike, from exploring hiking routes to identifying plants with artificial intelligence. Let's begin.

Our journey starts on the homepage, crafted with a modern and professional design. This is your main gateway to the application. Creating an account is simple. We ask for your name, email, and a strong password, using Django's built-in validators to ensure your account is secure from the start. For returning users, logging in is just as easy. And if you ever forget your password, our "Forgot Password" feature will securely send a reset link to your email. One of the best parts of our design is the seamless flow: after a successful registration, you are instantly logged in and redirected to the dashboard. No need to sign in again. It's a small detail that makes for a great user experience.

Once logged in, you arrive at your personal dashboard, the very heart of the Montanha Viva experience. This is your command center, a multi-view portal. In the main view, you get a quick overview with stats and charts. In the "Profile" section, you have full control over your account, allowing you to update your information, change your password, or delete your account in a secure, tabbed interface. The "About" page offers deeper insight into the Montanha Viva project, its mission, and its partners. And because we value your input, the "Send Feedback" page lets you submit bug reports, feature requests, or general comments, with the option to attach a file for more detail.

Now, for the most exciting part: the core features that make Montanha Viva truly unique.

Planning your next hike has never been easier. In the Route Encyclopedia, you can browse a comprehensive list of available trails and filter them by difficulty—Easy, Medium, or Hard—to find your perfect adventure. Clicking on any route opens a detailed view with its distance, duration, elevation changes, a map image, and even a downloadable GPX file for your navigation device.

Next, discover the rich biodiversity of the region in our Flora Encyclopedia. This section provides a searchable database of local plants. Clicking on a plant reveals a detailed profile with its scientific and common names, photographs, and fascinating information about its uses and interactions with local fauna.

And now, for the star of the show: the AI Plant Identifier. Have you ever been on a trail and wondered, "What plant is that?" With our AI, you can find out in seconds. Simply upload a photo of the plant from your device. Our backend, powered by a pre-trained PyTorch model, analyzes the image and returns an identification, complete with a confidence score. It's like having a botanist in your pocket.

To make exploration even more fun, we've hidden QR codes along the mountain trails. Use the "QR Codes" feature in the app to open your camera and scan them. Each unique scan earns you points, bringing you one step closer to unlocking rewards. All your hard-earned points are tracked on the "Points & Rewards" page, where you can see your current balance and scan history. Once you've collected enough, you can redeem them for rewards like discount coupons from our partners.

For the data enthusiasts, our Sensor Data page allows you to view real-time and historical data from IoT sensors placed at various stations. You can select a station, specify a date range, and view specific measurements like temperature and humidity in both a table and a graph.

Finally, for administrators, Montanha Viva includes a powerful and secure admin panel integrated right into the dashboard. This is not the standard Django admin; it's a custom-built, feature-rich interface for managing the entire application. Admins have full Create, Read, Update, and Delete control over users, hiking routes, the flora encyclopedia, QR codes, and all user feedback, all through user-friendly modals.

And that concludes our tour of the Montanha Viva application. It's a complete ecosystem, from its user-friendly pages and powerful interactive features to its comprehensive admin panel, all built with modern, robust technologies. Thank you for watching, and we hope you feel inspired to get out and explore.
